## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

## Defensive Programming

Defensive programming was manually tested with the below user acceptance testing:

| Page | Expectation | Test | Result | Fix | Screenshot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home | | | | | |
| | The page is expected to reload after submitting an incorrect email address and display the alert message stating, "Invalid email address. Please enter a valid email." | Deliberately input test@test without .com. | The feature behaved as expected, reloading and displaying the error alert message. | Test concluded and passed | ![screenshot](documentation/defprog/defprog1.png) |
| | The page is expected to reload after submitting an already subscribed email address and display the alert message stating, "You have already subscribed to our newsletter!" | Deliberately input test@test.com, which was already previously subscribed. | The feature behaved as expected, reloading and displaying the error alert message. | Test concluded and passed | ![screenshot](documentation/defprog/defprog2.png) |
| Register | | | | | |
| | The page is expected to redirect the logged user back to the Home page when attempting to brute force the URL of the Register page. | Brute forces the URL of the Register page when logged in. | The feature behaved as expected and redirected the logged user/superuser back to the Home page. | Test concluded and passed | ![screenshot](documentation/defprog/defprog3.png) |
| | The signup form is expected to display the illegible first name, illegible last name, and incorrect email address inline error messages and prevent the form from submitting. | Deliberately input the illegible first name, illegible last name, and incorrect email address. | The feature behaved as expected and displayed the inline errors. Apostrophes and hyphens are allowed because some name may contain, for example, Ava-May and O'Shea. | Test concluded and passed | ![screenshot](documentation/defprog/defprog6.png) |
| Login | | | | | |
| | The page is expected to redirect the logged user back to the Home page when attempting to brute force the URL of the Login page. | Brute forces the URL of the Login page when logged in. | The feature behaved as expected and redirected the logged user/superuser back to the Home page. | Test concluded and passed | ![screenshot](documentation/defprog/defprog4.png) |
| Sign Out | | | | | |
| | The page is expected to redirect the logged-out user or guest back to the Home page when attempting to brute force the Sign Out page URL. | Brute forces the URL of the Sign Out page when logged out or guest access. | The feature behaved as expected and redirected the logged-out user/guest back to the Home page. | Test concluded and passed | ![screenshot](documentation/defprog/defprog5.png) |
| User Profile | | | | | |
| | The page is expected to redirect the logged-out user or guest to the Login page when attempting to brute force the User Profile page URL. | Brute forces the URL of the User Profile page when logged out or guest access. | The feature behaved as expected and redirected the logged-out user/guest to the Login page. If the login is validated, it redirects the logged-in user to the User Profile page. | Test concluded and passed | ![screenshot](documentation/defprog/defprog7.png) |
| | The change name form is expected to display the illegible first name and illegible last name inline error messages and prevent the form from submitting. | Deliberately input the illegible first name and illegible last name. | The feature behaved as expected and reloaded the page to display inline error messages instead of submitting the form. | Test concluded and passed | ![screenshot](documentation/defprog/defprog8.png) |
| | The page is expected to redirect the logged-out user or guest to the Login page when attempting to brute force the User Profile's edit name page URL. | Brute forces the URL of the User Profile's edit name page when logged out or guest access. | The feature behaved as expected and redirected the logged-out user/guest to the Login page. If the login is validated, it redirects the logged-in user to the User Profile's edit name page. | Test concluded and passed | ![screenshot](documentation/defprog/defprog9.png) |
| | The page is expected to redirect the logged-out user or guest to the Login page when attempting to brute force the User Profile's the delete user modal URL. | Brute forces the URL of the User Profile's the delete user modal page when logged out or guest access. | The feature behaved as expected and redirected the logged-out user/guest to the Login page. If the login is validated, it redirects the logged-in user to the User Profile's page instead of deleting the account to prevent accidental deletion through brute forcing the account deletion URL. | Test concluded and passed | ![screenshot](documentation/defprog/defprog10.png) |
