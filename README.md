## UX

In this project, I follow the Five Planes of User Experience model invented by Jesse James Garrett.

### Five Planes of User Experience

This model aids in transforming from abstract ideas, such as creating objectives of the project and identifying the user needs, to concrete concepts, such as assembling visual elements to produce the visual design of the idea to meet the project's objectives and users' needs.

#### The Strategy Plane
The vision for SignCoding is to be a unique, inclusive learning platform where aspiring programmers can connect with expert sign language tutors and seamlessly learn programming languages. Unlike other platforms, SignCoding creates an accessible and empowering environment for deaf and hard-of-hearing students, ensuring effective communication and support throughout their coding journey.

##### Business Goals:
- Community Engagement: Foster a supportive community of aspiring programmers who share their learning experiences and progress. We value your feedback and aim to shape SignCoding based on your needs and preferences.
- Inclusive Learning: Create a dynamic and accessible learning platform enriched by high-quality tutoring services for deaf and hard-of-hearing students.
- Brand Identity: Establish SignCoding as the go-to platform for inclusive programming education, renowned for its intuitive, user-friendly interface and expert sign language tutors.

##### User Needs:
- Aspiring Programmers: A learning platform that provides expert sign language tutors to help them master programming languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and more.
- Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Students: An inclusive environment where communication is seamless and learning is tailored to their unique needs.
- Skill Seekers: Users who prefer a straightforward and practical learning experience focused on grasping programming concepts without unnecessary complexity.

In this context, the core value of SignCoding lies in providing a streamlined, inclusive learning experience focused on programming education and effective communication through sign language.

#### Scope Plane

Based on the main objective and goals set out in the Strategy Plane, these requirements for developing the website are broken down into two categories:

##### Functional Requirements:
- User Accounts and Profiles: Users should be able to create an account, set up a basic profile, and access tutoring sessions and services.
- Tutoring Sessions: A simple process for users to book and attend sign language tutoring sessions focused on programming languages.
- Tutor Listings: Display a list of tutors with their programming languages, sign languages, day availabilities, and time slot availabilities.
- Booking History: Users should be able to view their booking history and manage their sessions.
- Primary Navigation: Users should be able to navigate between their profile, tutor listings, and booking history.

##### Content Requirements:
- Tutor Profiles: Profiles for tutors showcasing their expertise, available programming and sign languages, and schedule.
- User Profiles: Basic profiles showing the user's booking history and upcoming sessions.

#### The Structure Plane

The requirements outlined in the Scope Plane were then used to create a structure for the website. A site map below shows how users can navigate the website easily.

### Colour Scheme

I used [Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co/palette/3c0008f9f6ee000000ffc107#justCreated) to generate my colour palette.

![screenshot](documentation/ux/colour_palette.png)

- `#F9F6EE` is used for the primary background, inverted font colour and secondary button.
- `#3C0008` is used for the primary navbar, main button, and footer colour.
- `#FFC107` is used for the secondary button.
- `#000` is used for the main font colour.

The colour palette for SignCoding represents the harmony between coding and sign language education, using vibrant colours to symbolise inclusivity and communication.  However, the colour palette needed to pass the minimum colour contrast set by the Web Content Accessibility Guide (WCAG). The colour palette was tested using [Coolors' Color Contrast Checker](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/). The result below shows that these colours passed the minimum WCAG contrast ratio.

### Typography

- [Bootstrap's native font stack](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/content/reboot/#native-font-stack) was used throughout the site.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer and buttons in a detailed gram view.
